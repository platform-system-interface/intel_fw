# Modern Intel Firmware Tool ✨

This is a new utility to analyze and edit firmware images for [Intel platforms](
docs/platforms.md).

Based on [knowledge](docs/knowledge.md) from other projects, such as
`me_cleaner`, coreboot's `ifdtool`, ME Analyzer and related research,
`intel_fw` is written from scratch in Rust, allowing for integration with other
projects, including a flexible API.

The [architecture and design](docs/architecture.md) is based on experience.

To test this tool, you will need sample [firmware images](docs/images.md).
For convenience, take a look at the [scripts](scripts/) used for development.

## Commands

### `me`

The `me` command lets you print, edit and check the (CS)ME firmware.
The `me clean` command is compatible with `me_cleaner`, with minor differences:

- The `--whitelist` and `--blacklist` flags do not cause deletion of partitions
  when multiple partitions refer to the same range, but at least one of them is
  to be retained. This is considered a bug fix.
- The `--check` flag checks _all_ directory partitions as well as the presence
  of the FTPR. Analysis details are printed unconditionally.
- The `--truncuate` option may result in smaller ME images than `me_cleaner`.

## Development

To run the CLI via `cargo` directly, remember to add arguments after an extra
`--`; i.e., to print the general help, invoke `cargo run --relase -- -h`, or,
for a subcommand, e.g. `cargo run --relase -- me clean -h`.

## TODOs

- [ ] sync up; <https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner> has another patch that
  coreboot is missing, doing rework and adding ME Gen 1 support
- [ ] [IFWI](https://github.com/platform-system-interface/intel_fw/issues/80)
  format support

## Funding

The [initial work](milestones.md#initial_work) has been sponsored through the
first [Open Call by the Open Source Firmware Foundation](https://www.osfw.foundation/funding/small-scale-high-impact-firmware-contributions-2025/). We highly appreciate
their support that made a first release of this project possible.
