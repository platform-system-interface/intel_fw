# Knowledge sources

## Official resources

Intel publishes general information on firmware in their developer portal:
<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/firmware/overview.html>
Note that the public information mainly focuses on host processor firmware.

## Forums

People are regularly [searching for tools and information around Intel platform](
https://community.intel.com/t5/Embedded-Intel-Core-Processors/Where-to-Download-Flash-Image-Tool-fitc/td-p/249920)
firmware, resorting to third-party forums because Intel does not publish what
they need or limits access to necessary resources to certain customers only,
notably not end users.
Here is a short list of places to find useful information and tools.

### Extraction

For older FIT tools, use `binwalk` to extract resources and then `grep` for
`LayoutEntry` to find descriptions of straps, which include the HAP bit, e.g.:

```
<LayoutEntry name="PCH_Strap_CSME_CSE_HAP_Mode" type="bitfield32"
    value="0x0" offset="0x68" bitfield_high="16" bitfield_low="16" />
```

Note that later generation XML files just call the HAP bit "reserved".
Educated guessing by looking at neighboring bits will help you to locate it.

Newer FIT tools (e.g., v18) contain Python code that can be extracted with
[pyinstxtractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor). Relevant
code is in the `plugins/` directory:

```sh
pyinstxtractor.py ../mfit_18.exe
ls -l tools.exe_extracted/plugins/
```
